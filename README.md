LONDON LIVE UNDERGROUND STATUS

The application displays the live status of the London undergraound transportation sytem.
The underground is also called the "Tube" and it serves 270 stations with 402kilometres, 45 per cent of which is 
underground. It is the second largest metro system in the world in route kilometres after the Shaghai metro. 

The application is simple and displays the status of the underground lines. It is a lightweight program that can be 
operated in various devices.

The application is build via the Phonegap platform version 1.9.0. It is also integrated with JQuery mobile version 1.1.1
for the user interface interaction and plenty of Javascript plugins and jquery code.

I would like to thanks Andrzej Jedrzejewski and Matt Entwistle who helped on the startup graphics of the application 
and especially on the logo of the application.
