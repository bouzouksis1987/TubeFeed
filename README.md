History

The London Underground incorporates the oldest section of underground railway in the world,
which opened in 1863 and now forms part of the Circle, Hammersmith & City, and Metropolitan lines 
and the first line to operate electric trains, in 1890, now part of the Northern line.

The Underground system is also colloquially called the Tube.
The Underground serves 270 stations and has 402 kilometres (250 mi) of track, 45 per cent of which is underground.
It is the second largest metro system in the world in terms of route miles, after the Shanghai Metro and part
of the largest system in terms of route miles when taken together with the Docklands Light Railway and the London 
Overground. It also has one of the largest numbers of stations.
